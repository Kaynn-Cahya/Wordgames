# Wordgames
I was really bored that day.

So I made a wordgame for fun.<br>Done in .NET Core console project, programmed using F#.

### Instruction
The game will give you a set of letters to use for you to construct a phrase/word.<br>Any word is acceptable as long as it is an english word*.
> *To be exact: An english word inside dwyl's english dictionary. Check references for more detail below.

Use the 'help' command in the console for more detailed information.<br>
Take note that phrases with whitespaces are replaced with dashes instead, like so `-`.

### References
The list of english word dictionaries was used from [dwyl's english words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/).
